PhysAnim is a Unity tool that enables physical animations through motor-based and keyframe-based ragdoll pose matching similar to those found in Star Wars: New Order or Uncharted 4.

## Goal

Real-Time CGI are now great enough to make the environment, the characters feel almost life-like and allowing blending between physics and animations and overall putting an emphasis on interactions is the last missing piece to create truly immersive experiences. VR/AR or high fidelity applications are crucial as the lack of interactivity (or bugs) can easily break the player's immersion.
The goal of PhysAnim is to bridge that last gap.

## Roadmap

- [X] Local motor-based pose-matching
- [X] Global keyframe-based pose-matching
- [ ] Physics to regular animation transitioning
- [ ] Self-balancing bipeds
